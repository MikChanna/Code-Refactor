# Code-Refactor

In this assignment, I was tasked with doing a code refactor for a company, Horiseon.  Essentially, I cleaned up the code I was given to make sure that it included semantic elements and making sure that the CSS code is efficient and it doesn't seem repetitive.  See below for the few things that I changed.
    1. Added nav, section, aside, footer semantic elements.
    2. Combined the CSS code for benefit classes, as well as their h3 headings and their images.
    3. Combined the CSS code for class search-engine-optimization, online-reputation-management, and social-media-marketing, as well their h2 headings and their images.
